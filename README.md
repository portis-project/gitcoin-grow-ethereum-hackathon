# Portis - Gitcoin Grow Ethereum 2019 Hackathon Challenge


Portis is a platform for making decentralized applications accessible to mainstream users. We offer developers an SDK that they can integrate into their decentralized application (DApp) to make it familiar and easy for their users, just like using a regular web app. 

**Portis is a standard web3 provider that comes pre-bundled in your DApp.**

Other web3 providers force DApps to place the burden on the end users, making them install a third-party application on their device before they can even start using said DApp. In addition, the user’s private key is stored only on the device, making it both risky (if the device is lost/destroyed, the user’s funds and identity are gone forever) and inconvenient – using the same wallet across different devices is an intimidating process for the average user.

With Portis the user doesn't have to do anything he isn't already familiar with. The application developer [only needs to add a couple of lines of code to integrate the Portis SDK](https://github.com/portis-project/web-sdk). Consequentially, users enjoy a built-in wallet in their existing browser, without needing to install anything, while still maintaining absolute control over their private key (Portis never knows what the user’s private key is). 

In addition, thanks to Portis’ end-to-end encryption architecture ([read our white paper](https://www.portis.io/whitepaper)), its users enjoy a friendly cloud experience, and can access the same account on all of their devices using a familiar email and password.

Finally, on top of the Ethereum mainnet, testnets and Goerli networks, Portis supports a long list of EVM compatible blockchains (POA, ThunderCore, Matic, RootStock, Ubiq, xDai and Fuse), as well as EOS and BTC ([more info](https://docs.portis.io/#/configuration?id=network)).

# :tv: Background

Mass adoption. It's the holy grail of blockchain applications. Everybody's saying it has to happen for blockchain to survive and eventually flourish. So how do we make it a reality?

We believe that with Portis, building a decentralized application with the average user in mind is no longer just wishful thinking. Users can maintain their decentralized identity and interact with the blockchain without being forced to understand complicated technical terms. Heck, they don't even have to know they're using a decentralized application at all!

Throw in features like ["Trust this App"](https://docs.portis.io/#/trust-this-app), ["Gas Relay"](https://docs.portis.io/#/gas-relay), ["Change Network"](https://docs.portis.io/#/methods?id=changenetwork), and more, and you can really take your UX to the level users are accustomed to.

## ✊ We want you to bring on the revolution of mainstream adoption ✊
## ⛽️ We want you to take advantage of the Gas Stations Network to do it ⛽️

# :rocket: Challenge

Portis was created to tackle issues like usability and user onboarding in DApps, but one issue has remained the biggest challenge since day one: gas fees. The crux of the problem is that you’re asking your users to overcommit to your application before they even had a chance to carry out one meaningful interaction with it.

The Gas Stations Network ([EIP-1613](http://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1613)) lets you sponsor your users' gas fees, all in a decentralized manner ([medium article](https://medium.com/@portis/sponsor-your-users-gas-fees-with-portis-and-tabookey-s-gas-stations-network-7fd7c8406869)). Right now it is only available on Ropsten, but mainnet release is coming very soon!

Build a DApp that anybody can use. Your parents, your highschool history teacher, anyone. With Portis powering your DApp, they'll only need to register with an email and password, from inside their browser, something they're already familiar with. 

Most DApps today provide some sort of "user guide" due to the complexity of onboarding and interacting with them. We think that's unacceptable. There are no instructions on how to use Instagram or Uber.

We will be looking for DApps created in the Hackathon that have taken our vision to heart. That have decided to utilize the frictionless experience provided by Portis to build a DApp with the mainstream crowd in mind. 

The only requirement we place, besides that you use Portis and create a kickass UI that feels just like a web2 app, is to utilize our gas relay functionality. **Let's blur the lines between web3 and web2.**

## The winner will walk away with a cool 3 ETH

## In addition, the winning project (as well as any noteable runners ups) will be presented during our talk at the [MetaCartel Demo Day Conference in Berlin, August 19th](https://www.metacartel.org/)
